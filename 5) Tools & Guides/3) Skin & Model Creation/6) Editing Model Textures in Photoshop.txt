For Editing the Texture File via a 3D Model/.obj File in Photoshop:
---
Open up the .obj file (3d model) of the weapon/object and double click the 
'material/default texture' layer. It will then open up a new window with the 
texture UV's (wireframe outlines). You can edit your texture on this alone, 
or you can import the default/regular texture .png into this window. 
The sizing/ratio should be the same and fit the UV outlines. When you want 
to view the texture on the 3D model window, just go back to that window and PS 
should automatically update it (depending on the version). If not, just press save 
on the material/default texture window. Always good to do that anyways.

(For easy previewing on the model real time etc.)
