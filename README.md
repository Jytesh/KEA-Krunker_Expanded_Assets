The Krunker Expanded Assets.zip is a compilation of extended assets and resources from Krunker.io and the community catered to Map Designers, Skin/Item Creators, Media Creators/Animators etc. Included, you should be able to find anything you'll need resource wise from Krunker.

You can also use the ‘Modding Template’ directories within the KEA.zip to build mod files from scratch.
